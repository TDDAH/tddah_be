# README

## Overview

TDDAH! introduces a new approach to learning and practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Rails. Seeking to transform how developers, especially students and newcomers, perceive and engage with software testing, TDDAH! celebrates progress and milestones in TDD through achievements, making the learning process both rewarding and fun.

### Requirements

Currently the only supported repos need to meet the following requirements

- Ruby
- Rails
- SimpleCov
- GitHub

and their .gitignore fil needs to be updated with the following:
```
# Ignore SimpleCov coverage reports, but allow the index.html file.
/coverage/*
!coverage/index.html 
```
and then it needs to be pushed up to GitHub.

This will allow TDDAH! access to the index.html file to acertain whether any achievements are met.

## Backend App Info

The backend is hosted on [Heroku](https://tddah-be-39c5a52e8b65.herokuapp.com/) and uses:
